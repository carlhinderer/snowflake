- Snowflake

    - Innovative cloud DW
    - Became commercially available in 2015
    - Largest software IPO in history in 2020
    - Secure and powerful, but cost-effective and simple to maintain



- Snowflake Web UIs

    - Classic Console = traditional UI
    - Snowsight = New UI, introduced in 2021, will be default for all accounts in 2023
    - All our hands-on exercises will be completed in Snowsight



- Snowsight Orientation

    - Menu bar has User Menu (with your username) and Main Menu
    - You can switch between roles, your default role for a new account is USERADMIN



- Navigating Snowsight Worksheets

    - Snowsight has auto-save and versioning history, you can revert back to a previous version of worksheet
    - We'll need to set the context to perform queries (virtual warehouse, database, schema)
    - In trial org, your default virtual warehouse is 'COMPUTE_WH'

    - Now, we'll create a new folder and worksheet
        > New Folder: 'Chapter1'
        > New Worksheet: Change name to 'Chapter 1 Getting Started'

        > Add First Queries:
            SELECT CURRENT_ROLE();
            SELECT CURRENT_WAREHOUSE();


    - Note that when we click run, only the current line where the cursor is will be run.  To run all 
        statements, highlight them all before running.  (Cntl+Enter is shortcut for Run)


    - Now, we'll see that we are not connected to a database:

        SELECT CURRENT_DATABASE();


    - We can set the context for our database either with the drop-down or with a USE command.

        USE DATABASE SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA;


    - To set the current scheama, use the drop-down to select 'TPCDS_SF100TCL'.  To see the current
        schema:

        SELECT CURRENT_SCHEMA();


    - The blue buttons can be selected/deselected:

        Objects      # Whether you see the objects on the left side of screen
        Editor       # Whether or not you see the query editor
        Results      # Whether you see the query results
        Chart        # Whether you see chart view


    - Use the drop-down menu and select 'Format query' to have your SQL query neatly reformatted.

    - Use the drop-down menu and select 'Show shortcuts' to get a list of command shortcuts.

    - Use the drop-down on the right side of the screen 'updated 1 minute ago' to access complete history 
        for the worksheet.  A new version is saved every time a SQL query is run.

    - Click the house icon in the upper left to go back to the homepage.



- Important Caveats

    - For object names, we'll use all uppercase since it is the recommended default.  If we use mixed case
        or all lowercase, the name must be contained in quotes.

    - When creating an object, we can use CREATE, or optionally you can add either the IF NOT EXISTS or
        OR REPLACE syntax.  For our examples, we'll use CREATE OR REPLACE so that you can always go back
        to exercises at the beginning of the chapter.  In production, we should use CREATE IF NOT EXISTS.
